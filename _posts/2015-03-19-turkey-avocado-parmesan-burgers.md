You only need 3 ingredients for these juicy, healthy and tasty burgers. 

I really enjoy using my mini George Foreman grill when making burgers. It's designed to let the fat drip off the grill for a healthy bonus. Never fear, the burgers are still juicy once cooked because of the mixed in Parmesan!
